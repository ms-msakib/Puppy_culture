          On the top level, Puppy Culture is a
          <b> socialization <br /> and training program</b>
          specifically developed for puppies, from birth through the end of their critical socialization period. <br />
          <br />
          It includes age appropriate protocols and lessons laid out in an organized format. <br />
          <br />
          The program consists of videos, books and a Workbook, but that really does not get to the “why” of Puppy Culture, or what makes it different!

      <h2 className='text-center'>The Why of Puppy Culture</h2>
      <div className="main2 d-flex">
        <div className="para2 col-md-6">
          <br /> <br />
          Puppy Culture is based on the premise that the puppy always <br />
          leads the learning, and puppies learn best by appropriate <br />
          experiences at the appropriate time. <br />
          <br />
          So what we are doing is teaching you to observe the puppy, and, <br />
          based on the behavioral markers you see, serve the puppy the <br />
          experience or lesson that is optimal for him at that moment in
          <br /> time.
